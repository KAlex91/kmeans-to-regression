# Kmeans to Regression - Advanced Regression Techniques
Notebook for "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" Kaggle's competition

Competition Description

Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.
With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

Acknowledgments
The Ames Housing dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's an incredible alternative for data scientists looking for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset.
All the data used can be found on the competition's page.

In this notebook I used dimension reduction using kmeans clustering , which is an unsupervised learning algorithm. Instead of feature selection or feature engineering, I have reduced the dimension by grouping or clustering most of the similar features together and they are categorized or labeled accordingly, making the preprocessing a lot more sharper.
